## Personal Finance
### Budgeting
#### Quick Recommendations
1. An emergency fund should account for at least 6 continuous months of expenses sans income.
2. Use IRAs or high yield savings accounts.
3. Think of the future, invest in the future.
4. Ask for itemised bills in a medical setting.  

#### What is budgeting?
A budget is a plan for the coordination of revenues, expenses, and _most importantly_ – a growth in savings over a period of time; it covers a specific period of time, usually weekly or monthly.

_A budget allows you to have:_  
- A greater control of your future.  
- An ability to plan for and mitigate problems.  

_Proper budgeting forces you to ask: why?_

#### Why budget?
Having a budget can help you feel more in control of your finances and make it easier for you to not overspend and to save money. When you budget your money, you are less likely to amass large debts, are more likely to lead a more comfortable life in retirement, and are better prepared for emergencies.

#### How to budget?

Refer to `Example.ods` in the directory that contains this file.

You can make a budget before you start spending or you can use your current spending to make one. The beginning of _any_ budgetary decision or process _must_ be goal setting – without a goal, what is the point of tracking your money? A budget _has_ to be concise, clear, realistic, it has to have a timeframe, and you _have to know how you're going to do it._

It is _better_ to start from scratch when you don't have an existing budget, building one from how you already spend is counterproductive due to human psychology (it's _very_ difficult to change habits.) Budget for your ideal scenario according to your income, and work towards it.

_Types of goals:_  
- Short term: weeks to 6 months.  
- Medium term: 6 months to a year.  
- Long term: more than a year.  

_The Salge steps to a successful budget:_  
1. Set your goals and categorise them in terms.  
2. Find your income and expenses –  _track them_.  
3. Plan for future expenses – _see below for methods of budgeting._  
4. Evaluate and manage the budget.  
Once the budget is established, it is common to use exclusively steps 1 and 4.

> **Budgeting to Zero**  
> Also known as zero-based budgeting, all of your income _must_ be allocated _before_ spending. Budgeting to zero means dividing income into categories of expense (e.g. groceries, gas, savings, investments, etc,) making sure _all_ funds have been assigned a purpose, and that at the end of the month, there is a zero balance in the budget.

> **50/30/20 Method**  
> This budget is a plan that sorts expenses into three categories:  
> - 50% – Needs  
> - 30% – Wants  
> - 20% – Savings  

#### Modern Budgeting
It is advisable for you to use a budgeting program on a mobile device and/or a computer. However, you may want to avoid certain programs because they collect and sell your data – _read the EULA/Terms & Conditions!_ – or sell you products based on your budget or purchases.

_Features to look for:_  
- Categorisation of budgets or purchases.  
- Real-time tracking.  
- Budgeting to zero.  

### Credit
#### Credit Cards
 Get a credit card in your name, ideally with rewards.
 
 An example:
 
 > **Capital One Quick Silver** – You get 1.5% back for every dollar spent, so every $100 = $1.50 back, and you can set it up to automatically pay the credit to your account. 19.24% - 29.24% APR after intro period.

_Tips and tricks:_  
- Be responsible.  
- _Never_ miss a payment, _ever_.
- Don’t get close to your credit limit.  
- Only buy on a credit card _what you can afford to buy_ on a debit card at the same point in time.  
- Pay in _full_, if you only pay the minimum each month, the credit card companies will charge you interest for using their money longer than the 30 day statement period.

#### Credit Reports & Scores
The two are in fact, different – a credit report is a detailed record of your credit history, including your payment history and current credit accounts, while a credit score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness based on the information in your credit report. Having a high credit score can make it easier to get a loan, rent an apartment, or lower your insurance rate. The US government provides [one free credit report](https://www.usa.gov/credit-reports) per year, but does not provide free credit scores. 

_You can get your credit score in [three ways](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/where-can-i-get-my-credit-scores-en-316/), two listed because they are easier:_  
1. Check your credit or loan statement.  
2. Buy your score from one of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion.

### Insurance
Remember to _always_ read the fine print.

#### What is insurance?
Insurance is an agreement between you and another party – usually a corporation or government agency – that guarantees to compensate for a _specific_ loss, damage, illness, or death in return of the payment of a premium. Insurance is a form of risk management. Keep in mind that many more types of insurance exist, the below are the most popular types in the U.S. 

| Type        | Coverages                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Health Insurance
Health insurance in the United Sates is _very_ complicated. You, the consumer gets screwed over a significant amount prior to getting care. That aside, health insurance is most commonly provided by either your employer or the government. Government "provided" healthcare is available via [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/#/) by typing in your ZIP code.

| Term                  | Definition                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insured               | Person(s) govered by the insurance policy.                                                                            |
| Deductible            | Annal threshold you must reach by paying out of picket before insurance makes _any_ payments.                         |
| Premium               | Amount of money paid in a billing period to buy the coverage.                                                         |
| Co-payment            | Flat-rate fee paid for a specific service or medical visit, insurance pays the rest                                   |
| Coinsurance           | Percentage you pay after you meet the deductible threshold, insurance will only pay a fraction of the bill, e.g. 70%. |
| Out-of-pocket maximum | Maximum amount of money you will spend in one year for any health-related expense.                                    |
| In-network            | Doctors and hospitals that your insurance has a contractual agreement with - both make more money.                    |
| Out-of-network        | Doctors and hospitals that don't have a contract with your insurance - _much_ more expensive.                         |

There are many types of health insurance plans available, the most common of which are HMOs, PPOs, EPOs, and POS. Choosing a plan determines your out-of-pocket costs and which doctors you can see. Choose a plan based on the benefits and coverages – you can ask for a summary of benefits – then compare your needs to the coverages.

| Type of Plan                    | Must Stay in Network for Coverage | Referral Requirement for Procedures and Specialists | Etc.                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Health Maintenance Organisation | Yes, except for emergencies.      | Yes, usually.                                       | Lower out-of-pocket costs and a primary doctor who coordinates your care for you, but less freedom to choose providers. |
| Preferred Provider Organisation | No, but cheaper in-network care.  | No.                                                 | More provider options and no required referrals, but higher out-of-pocket costs.                                        |
| Exclusive Provider Organisation | Yes, except for emergencies.      | No, usually.                                        | Lower out-of-pocket costs and usually no required referrals, but less freedom to choose providers.                      |
| Point of Service                | No, but cheaper in-network care.  | Yes.                                                | More provider options and a primary doctor who coordinates your care for you, with referrals required.                  |

Referrals refer to the procedure where you must see a primary care physician prior to scheduling a procedure or visiting a specialist. HMOs usually are the cheapest type of plan. Networks _matter_ too, a larger network means you get access to doctors for cheaper more frequently – or that you have more choices. _Do not_ choose any plans that don't have local in-network doctors if possible. The point is to give yourself _as much flexibility as possible_ for the _least_ amount of expenses in medical bills and premiums.
