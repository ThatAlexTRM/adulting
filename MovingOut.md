## Stuff you need to be in possession of:
- [ ] Social Security Card.
- [ ] Original Birth Certificate – you can get it at the court house in the county where you were born.
- [ ] Immunisation & health records, medications you take, list of known allergies.
- [ ] Passport(s), driver's licenses, etc.

## Stuff you have to acquire/do/get in your name:
- [ ] Title to our own vehicle (transfer cost ~ $100, requires signatures of all listed on title.)
- [ ] Auto insurance.
- [ ] Health insurance.
- [ ] Cellular plan.
- [ ] Credit Card
- [ ] [Change your address](https://www.usps.com/manage/forward.htm) once you have a place to live.
- [ ] Any financial accounts (banks, cards, investments, etc) – **you need to be the owner of the account**, make sure your parents are not "custodians".

## Stuff you NEED to survive:

- [ ] Shelter –  ideally a low rent apartment with roommates to save money, or in a dorm if you are going to post-secondary education. Don't worry if it's not fancy, as long as you have a place to sleep out of the rain, be happy
- [ ] Income - to pay for rent, food, insurance, etc
- [ ] Determination.

## Budget breakdown

> Depending upon where you live, $500 / wk is enough to survive, but you don't want to settle for that long term. My first apartment (in a suburb of St Louis, MO) was $650 / month + utilities, but there were much cheaper ones that weren't as nice. This was in 2008, so I'd imagine it's higher now, and you can eat healthy food even on a tight budget. You'll bring in about $2200 / month...
> 
> - \~ 20% tax. can't get around that (legally) -> $1760 / month left
> 
> - $1000 / mo for rent & utilities. Again, I'll stress, FIND ROOMMATES. Utilities will include electricity, water, sewer, trash, gas, and internet. You DO NOT need cable, Netflix, etc. There is plenty of entertainment on the internet, and I'd consider that an essential utility today. Try to keep your cell phone plan in this budget as well, that means low data through put, and likely, not playing on your phone much. You DO NOT need the latest, greatest phone. The low end models do just as good. You don't need a super computer in your pocket.
> 
> - $200 / mo for health insurance. Shop for plans on [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/).
> 
> - $200 / mo for groceries / eating out. Use coupons, go to cheaper stores (like Aldi, although they don't use coupons), DON'T BUY anything you don't need, never go shopping when you're hungry or really upset about something. I don't recommend eating out much at all.
> 
> - $300 / mo for car insurance, gas, payments, & maintenance. Sounds tight? It is. Don't joy ride, get a cheap but reliable used car that gets decent gas mileage (Corolla FTW), and get minimum coverage. Don't speed, don't drive recklessly, and don't do anything that will cost you in the long run. Actually, do you need car? Can you bike to work, take public transport? Will you live on a university campus?
> 
> - Leftover - whatever you have at the end of the month, SAVE. You will always need cash for emergencies, fixing your car, buying a new appliance, etc. DO NOT buy things or go out to eat just because you have an extra $20 in your pocket. Save that for when you need it.

## Other Advice

- In the US, you get 1 [free credit report from the government](https://www.usa.gov/credit-reports) per year.

- Learn a trade - you don't need a college degree, but you do need to know how to do something useful (plumbing, electrician, etc). You can [take online courses for free](http://mooc.org/) to learn how to do other things like software.

- Get an online checking account with no fees, with mobile deposits (take a picture of a check in the app), and no ATM fees. It also earns something like 1.5% interest on the bank balance. But also keep some cash locally, in a safe or something, in case you need it quickly.

- If you have extra time, get another job.

- Take care of your body. Don't eat junk. Get plenty of sleep. Don't drink alcohol or smoke (you don't have the budget for that anyway). Exercise regularly. It will help your mood and give you the energy you need to push through this difficult time in your life. Brush and floss your teeth. Sometimes health insurance cover dental checkups too.

- Get your clothes, etc from Goodwill or other second hand stores. Sometimes, they are even really overpriced, but it's still better than full price for things.

- Get a nice suit & tie, something that makes you feel confident and fits you well. You'll want that for any interviews/meeting you may have.

- Track your actual budget using a spreadsheet program. You will want to fine tune how much you have available for certain expenses.

- Remember, your goal is not just to survive, but to improve. If your current situation is unchanging and is unlikely to change, then you need to take a radical approach to restructuring your life.
